- figure out why cpu usage is high on client and server, probably has to do with spinning calls on enet?
- make sure I'm using packets correctly, do I have to delete them, is it alright to use flush to send the packets... 
- start by rendering something basic, so that I know graphics is working over the network
- add in text rendering and draw information to the screen about the rates things are being sent and received
- add in jolt physics on server side, and use that to draw something basic
- render a map and a ball which you can roll around or something along those lines
- add client side interpolation and reconciliation
